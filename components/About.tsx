            <p>
              Founded in Dubai, Habot Connect DMCC emerged from a simple yet powerful idea: 
              every parent should have easy access to quality learning support for their child. 
              We recognized that finding the right specialist for children with learning 
              difficulties was often overwhelming and time-consuming for families.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team of educators, technologists, and parents came together to create a 
              platform that puts families first. We carefully vet each provider, gather 
              authentic reviews, and present information in a clear, accessible way that 
              helps parents make informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we're proud to serve families across the region, connecting them with 
              specialists in areas ranging from ADHD coaching and dyslexia support to autism 
              therapy and general learning disabilities. Our commitment remains unchanged: 
              making quality learning support accessible to every child who needs it.
